\NEW{In this paper, we present the development of an computer vision algorithm which can detect sidewalks based on line detection. The main functions of algorithm are inducing pedestrians to follow right ways to across sidewalks. Most sidewalk detection algorithms are using color histogram analysis to extract the area of sidewalk. However, our algorithm is based on the line detection because there are various kinds of patterns and colors used in detecting sidewalks all over the world. The development of the algorithms is performed using a Walking Assistance Mobile Application for visually impaired people and can be used in no extra device and technology.}
